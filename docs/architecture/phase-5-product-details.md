# Phase 5: Product Details Page (PDP) Architecture

## 1. Overview & Objective
Phase 5 implements the complete, responsive product details experience for **Nordic Marketplace** (`http://localhost:4242`). The design realizes an original Scandinavian e-commerce atmosphere: warm off-white surfaces (`#FAF9F6`), soft sage accents (`#78947B`, `#536F57`, `#E7EFE5`), charcoal typography (`#292E29`), restrained borders, generous whitespace, and artisan-focused merchandising.

The PDP provides:
- **Product Route (`/products/[slug]`)**: Resolves products by either UUID or slug, supporting both live backend inventory and demonstration fixtures.
- **Product Image Gallery**: Stable aspect ratio, Next.js Image priority optimization, thumbnail strip, and accessible lightbox zoom dialog.
- **Title, Pricing & VAT**: Accurate EUR formatting (`formatFinnishCurrency`), Finnish VAT breakdown (`sis. ALV` / `+ ALV`), and store attribution.
- **Variant Selection**: Interactive variant switching (size, color, model) with live pricing updates and real-time inventory limits.
- **Quantity Selector**: Plus/minus controls bound to stock limits.
- **Add-to-Cart & Wishlist**: Integrated purchase controls with loading states, stock validation, and Sonner toast notifications.
- **Delivery & Trust Card**: Standard Finnish delivery window (2–4 arkipäivää), 14-day statutory return policy under the Finnish Consumer Protection Act, and buyer protection.
- **Product Information Tabs**: Accessible shadcn `Tabs` for Description, Specifications (SKU, VAT rate, return eligibility), Maker information (Y-tunnus, address, storefront link), and Shipping & Returns.
- **Customer Reviews**: Direct integration with the backend verified reviews API (`GET /marketplace/products/:id/reviews`) with star rating distribution (5★ to 1★) and verified purchaser badges.
- **Related Products**: Merchandising grid reusing the Phase 3 `ProductCard`.
- **Custom 404 Not-Found Page**: Dedicated Scandinavian error page (`app/not-found.tsx`) with recovery navigation.

## 3. Real Backend API Integration

The Product Details Page integrates directly with the NestJS backend:

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose | Response Structure | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `/marketplace/:id` | `GET` | Single published product detail | Full product object with store, variants, images | **Active & Integrated** |
| `/marketplace/products/:productId/reviews` | `GET` | Public verified customer reviews | `{ averageRating, totalReviews, distribution, reviews }` | **Active & Integrated** |
| `/customer/cart/items` | `POST` | Add item to customer cart | `{ productId, variantId, quantity }` | **Active & Integrated** |
| `/marketplace` | `GET` | Related products & slug discovery | `{ data: Product[], total, page, limit }` | **Active & Integrated** |

---

## 4. Variant Selection & Inventory Logic

1. **Variant Attribute Dimensions**:
   - Analyzes available dimensions (`size`, `color`, `model`, `attributeKey`/`attributeValue`).
   - Displays clear option pills with accessible radio semantics (`role="radiogroup"`).
2. **Dynamic Price Updates**:
   - If a selected variant defines an override price (`variant.price`), the main price display immediately reflects the variant price formatted in EUR.
3. **Inventory Bounds**:
   - Real-time stock display (`Varastossa 99 kpl`).
   - If stock is `0`, disables variant selection and marks as *"Loppu"*.
   - Quantity selector limits upper bound to `Math.min(stockQuantity, 99)`.
